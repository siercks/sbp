Pong, realized through my Silly Bus Sim assets.

W is up,
S is down.
Space bar to pause.

There are still things to work on, to include:
1. <s>Making sure computer AI doesn't get stuck on wall.</s>
2. <s>Adding pause menu, because I forgot that's important.</s>
3. Adding music + sound.<br>
4. Ensuring final score passthrough can successfully post on Game Over screen.
5. Add difficulty levels to CPU.
