Pong, realized through my Silly Bus Sim assets.

W is up,
S is down.

There are still things to work on, to include:
1. Making sure computer AI doesn't get stuck on wall.
2. Adding music + sound.
3. Ensuring final score passthrough can successfully post on Game Over screen.

Did this project in a little under 8 hours.
